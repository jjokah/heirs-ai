It is usually a small amount, compared to what Heirs General Insurance will pay. It is your way of accepting some responsibility to keep your property safe. When you have a claim, the fixed amount and the percentage option will be assessed. You will be required to pay the higher of the two. However, to avoid Excess charges on your claim, you have the option to buy the excess back at the start of the policy.\n\n**Excess Buy Back**, therefore, is the money you pay to cover up for the excess charge at the inception of a policy which is between 0.5% -1% of the value of the car. Always check your policy document for the terms of your cover.\n\n## We’re human, above all else\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, you are our priority.

Through this gathering, Heirs Insurance Group firmly positioned itself at the forefront of championing an inclusive travel ecosystem.\n\nDesigned around the theme, “Promoting Cultural Diversity and an Inclusive Travel Ecosystem,” the event opened with a high-level panel on “Passport Power and Diplomacy,” featuring Ambassador Manuel Innocencio de Lacerda Santos Junior, a Brazilian diplomat with five decades of service across four continents; Ambassador Jose Bamóquina Zau, Angola’s Ambassador to Nigeria and former Deputy Minister; Stephanie Busari, CEO, SBB Media and former CNN Senior Editor; moderated by veteran broadcaster, Jonathan Hanson.

Popular travel creators, Zim Erobu, Adenike Tejuoso, and Steven Ndukwu advocated for a borderless Africa with fewer travel restrictions within the continent. They also called for refunds for rejected visa, highlighting the unfairness of the visa process and how this increases the financial burden of Africans.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Ifesinachi Okpagu, Chief Marketing Officer of Heirs Insurance Group, said: “The Heirs Insurance Travel Festival provides the platform to address critical challenges within the often-overlooked travel ecosystem, ensuring that travel and migration policies are equitable for all. We believe access, safety, and empowerment should be for everyone.

  "markdown": "# Niyi Onifade: Meet the man behind one of Nigeria’s fastest-growing insurance companies\n\nFor many Nigerians, insurance has always been that thing you know you should care about, but somehow never do, until disaster strikes. It has lived quietly on the margins of everyday life, treated as optional, distant or even unnecessary.\n\nYet when homes burn, cars are wrecked, or medical emergencies erupt, it is the absence of insurance that pushes families into crisis.\n\nAt the forefront of changing that perception is Niyi Onifade, CEO of Heirs Life Assurance, a member of Heirs Insurance Group, Nigeria’s fastest-growing insurance group. A seasoned Chartered Insurer with over three decades of experience in financial services, Onifade joined Heirs Insurance in 2015 as its pioneering CEO, helping build the company from the ground up.\n\nIn 2020, he became the first MD/CEO of Heirs Life Assurance, leading its successful launch and positioning the firm as a trailblazer in Nigeria’s insurance space through innovation and customer-focused solutions.\n\nToday, he provides strategic leadership across the Heirs Insurance Group, driving synergy, transformation, and performance, all while championing the mission to democratise insurance across Africa.\n\nTo read the full interview on Business Insider Africa, click [here](https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/leaders/niyi-onifade-meet-the-man-behind-one-of-nigerias-fastest-growing-insurance-companies/4s2j8xd)."

  "markdown": "# Her Motor Insurance Cover - Heirs Insurance Group\n\n**Excess** is the fixed amount or a percentage of every claim that you, the insured, are expected to bear when you have a claim. It is usually a small amount, compared to what Heirs General Insurance will pay. It is your way of accepting some responsibility to keep your property safe. When you have a claim, the fixed amount and the percentage option will be assessed. You will be required to pay the higher of the two. However, to avoid Excess charges on your claim, you have the option to buy the excess back at the start of the policy.\n\n**Excess Buy Back**, therefore, is the money you pay to cover up for the excess charge at the inception of a policy which is between 0.5% -1% of the value of the car. Always check your policy document for the terms of your cover."

  "markdown": "# Top 3 Insurance Companies in Nigeria Leading Digital Innovation in 2025\n\nFor decades, the word “insurance” in Nigeria was often met with side-eyes and shrugs, a concept many considered foreign, unnecessary, or at best, a last resort. Stories of unfulfilled claims and endless paperwork left a sour taste in the mouths of everyday Nigerians. But slowly, something is changing.\n\nToday, more Nigerians are warming up to the idea of protecting what matters, be it their health, homes, businesses, or future, with insurance. And this shift is not just a matter of improved awareness. It is also a digital story.\n\nIn an age where convenience is king, a new crop of insurance companies is rewriting the playbook. From user-friendly mobile apps and AI-powered chatbots to seamless online claims and payment platforms, these companies are meeting Nigerians where they are: on their phones, at their fingertips, and on their terms.\n\nSo, what companies are leading this quiet but powerful revolution?\n\nLet us take a closer look at the top insurance companies in Nigeria that are combining digital ingenuity with financial strength making protection accessible, through innovation, trust, and technology.\n\n1.  **Axa Mansard:**\n\nAXA Mansard has long been seen as one of the pioneers of digital insurance in Nigeria, and the company continues to evolve its offerings to meet the needs of today’s digital-first consumer. Its mobile app, MyAxa Plus, offers customers the ability to manage health plans, book hospital visits, and access insurance support, all in one place.\n\nThe app has recorded over 100,000 downloads, reflecting its popularity among customers seeking a convenient insurance experience. Beyond health, AXA’s digital platform supports other insurance purchases with just a few taps, enabling customers to get covered without setting foot in a branch.\n\n2.  [**Heirs Insurance Group:**](https://heirsinsurancegroup.com/)\n\nHeirs Insurance Group earned the title of Nigeria’s fastest-growing insurance Group due to its rapid financial growth and the initiatives it has pioneered since its launch in 2021. The insurance group is reshaping how everyday Nigerians access insurance through innovation and technology.\n\nAt the centre of its digital ecosystem is its mobile app with the cheeky name, SimpleLife, which allows users to buy a wide range of insurance policies including motor, travel, life insurance and more, as well as file claims easily. The app has recorded over 70,000 downloads on iOS and Android.\n\nThis is supported by other user-friendly tools, including an AI-powered WhatsApp chatbot it calls Prince; a USSD code for quick access to insurance; and what it calls Nigeria’s first digital insurance experience centre for walk-in convenience.\n\nAccording to a report, in 2024, the Group recorded a 200% increase in revenue from its digital channels when compared to the same period in 2024. This proves the effectiveness of its tech-led model and consumers’ willingness to utilise digital channels for insurance.\n\n3.  **Leadway Assurance:**\n\nLeadway Assurance is successfully blending its decades-long legacy with modern technology to deliver value to a new generation of customers. The Leadway App, available on major app stores, enables users to access and manage a wide range of insurance products, from motor to investment-linked plans.\n\nWith over 50,000 app downloads, Leadway continues to invest in digital upgrades that simplify everything from policy purchase to claims tracking. The company also integrates digital customer service and chat support on its website and social media, making help accessible without queues or delays.\n\nIts digital strategy also includes financial literacy content and tools that help users better understand insurance, turning what was once a complex subject into everyday conversation.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nFrom mobile apps to AI assistants, Nigeria’s leading insurance companies are proving that the future of insurance lies in simplicity, speed, and digital access. With each of these three companies making it easier to get covered, file claims, and stay protected, insurance in Nigeria is no longer a luxury or mystery, but a service just a tap away.\n\nFor Nigerians looking to insure their lives, cars, health, or homes, the message is clear: there is an app for that, and the experience is getting better every day.\n\n**_Originally published by Naira Metrics._**"

  "markdown": "# How an Insurance Company Is Using Entertainment to Promote Insurance Education in Africa\n\nWhen Suits, the globally acclaimed American television series hit the screens in 2011, no one could have predicted the cultural phenomenon it would become. Centered around the glamorous world of corporate attorneys and set against the fast-paced backdrop of New York’s legal battleground, Suits took what many considered a dull profession and transformed it into prime-time magic.\n\nThe success of Suits proved quite clearly that any industry, no matter how traditionally unglamorous and ambiguous it has been perceived, can be made interesting when it is presented through emotional depth and cultural relevance.\n\nMy love for Suits amplified my excitement when I learned that Heirs Insurance Group was developing the first-ever insurance web series in Africa. It’s objective: to promote insurance education and drive insurance penetration in Nigeria and across the continent.\n\nThe reasons behind the project are stark: insurance penetration in Nigeria is less than 1% and across Africa, less than 3%, far less global averages. On a continent with a higher low-middle class, it is paradoxical that insurance is not a default for everyone.\n\nThe project objective was ambitious. It was, therefore, both refreshing and inspiring to see Heirs Insurance Group take such a bold and creative step, leveraging entertainment, particularly film, to educate, inform, and spark interest in an industry that is not quite understood or readily accepted by the masses.\n\n**The Underwriters: Where Insurance Meets Entertainment**\n\nAt first glance, pairing insurance with filmmaking feels like seeing a ballerina walk into a boxing ring; two worlds that rarely intersect. Surprisingly, [Heirs Insurance Group](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/) pulled it off.\n\nLaunched in the tail end of 2024, their film series tagged “[The Underwriters](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKzX6UG7Pf2mz_107GUXMtkXPsHThxHKx)” took the digital space by surprise, quickly amassing hundreds of thousands of views across YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook within the first month of premiering. It told a simple love story set in an insurance company but with the lives of everyday people woven intricately to educate the audience of the importance of insurance.\n\nBut more than the numbers, what truly stood out was how deeply the show resonated with its viewers. Real-life scenarios rooted in everyday realities, told the story of how truly relevant insurance could be if more people understood and embraced it.\n\nOne of the major hindrances to insurance penetration in Nigeria is the widely held perception that the profession is meant for the “experts” or highly knowledgeable people. However, Heirs Insurance Group did the unexpected: they plugged into the African love for exciting and emotionally engaging motion pictures, reimagining insurance and demystifying stereotypes, while also entertaining the audience.\n\nIn the same way, Suits made corporate law thrilling by humanising its characters and placing the audience in the high-stakes decisions of legal professionals, “The Underwriters” does the same with insurance. It does not just dramatise policy sales or claim settlements, it brings them to life, making the viewers experience the everyday life of an insurance professional. With the project, people could finally understand what insurance meant for everyone.\n\n**Creativity with Intentionality**\n\nWhat made “The Underwriters” an instant hit is the intentionality. The web series was not a random idea thrown together in a boardroom. It was the product of a bold strategy by Heirs Insurance Group to reinvent how insurance is perceived, especially by younger, digitally native Africans.\n\nThe objective was to make insurance a lifestyle and present its value in a simple and understandable manner. Dismantling the many myths around insurance, like the notion that insurers never pay claims or that insurance is only for the wealthy and educated, or for the religious, the notion of faith answering all, Heirs Insurance Group was intentional in making sure the series serves both as a brand-building tool and a platform for public enlightenment and awareness.\n\n**Meeting the Market Where It Is – The Power of Digital Know-how**\n\nIn today’s world, the audience wants to be served at the comforts of their devices. They would rather binge-watch a web series on YouTube or scroll through reels on Instagram. This is where Heirs Insurance has shown true creativity. Rather than wait for the market to come to them, they have gone to the market in its language, on its platforms, and through its cultural lenses. The series is available online, so anyone anywhere can watch.\n\nAnd the results speak for themselves. With nearly 200k views, the web series has sparked real conversations, prompting questions and comments around insurance.\n\nSome of the comments from viewers include:\n\n*   _“Breathtaking mindset, I love it trust me._\n*   _First insurance movie in the federation and industry as a whole…_\n*   _“This was an interesting watch. What better way to learn about insurance and be entertained while at it”_\n*   From far away, Zimbabwe, one viewer said, _“I’m a Claims Examiner in Zimbabwe, and I am enjoying the series. Well done team._\n\nHeirs Insurance Group is not just trying to market products, it is overhauling mindsets. By tapping into entertainment, the Group has managed to change the tone of the industry, from cold to cool, from aloof to approachable and inclusive. And in a space where so many brands are fighting for attention, this makes all the difference.\n\nIn the end, The Underwriters is not just a clever piece of communication, it is a bold declaration that insurance can be as much a part of your lifestyle as your fashion choices or streaming preferences.\n\n_Originally published on [Business Insider](https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/how-an-insurance-company-is-using-entertainment-to-promote-insurance-education-in/smnpm7l)_"

  "markdown": "# How Much Is a Nigerian Life Really Worth?\n\n_Written by – Reynold Ibe, Head, Product Development & Innovation, Heirs Insurance Group_\n\nLiving in Nigeria comes with a unique set of challenges. Every day, millions of Nigerians wake up to face a day filled with difficult choices and encounters: rising costs of goods, threats on the roads, a weak healthcare system, and income insecurity. It begets the question: how much is my life really worth, and how can I make my life more valuable?\n\nNigeria’s economy remains largely cash-driven, with over 60% of money in circulation existing outside the formal banking system, according to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This means that most Nigerians operate without structured financial safety nets, leaving them and their families exposed to sudden financial crises. Add to this the country’s alarmingly high mortality rates: 117 per 1,000 live births for children under five and a maternal mortality rate of 512 per 100,000 live births (World Bank), and the reality becomes clear: life is fragile, unpredictable, and often cut short too soon.\n\nIf an emergency struck today, how prepared are you? If something happened to you, would your family be financially secure? These are not just theoretical questions; they demand real, immediate answers.\n\n**The Cost of Inaction**\n\nDespite the many undeniable benefits of life insurance, only 1.9% of Nigerians have any form of insurance, according to the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM). This low adoption rate is due to a lack of awareness, cultural perceptions, and affordability concerns. But think about it—if an unexpected event wipes out everything you’ve worked for, will your regrets be worth it?\n\nInstead of asking whether you can afford life insurance, ask yourself if you can afford NOT to have it.\n\n**Why Nigerians Must Take Action Now**\n\nOne of the biggest financial risks Nigerians face is the cost of healthcare. Quality medical treatment remains unaffordable for many, forcing families to delay treatment or seek subpar alternatives. In a country where social security is weak and government assistance is limited, the reality is stark: one health crisis could mean financial ruin.\n\nAnd yet, millions of Nigerians continue to live without a financial backup plan. Many prioritise short-term expenses over long-term security. But when a crisis comes—whether it is an accident, illness, or even death—who bears the burden? Would your loved ones have to struggle or depend on charity just to survive?\n\n**Life Insurance: The Answer to Your “What Ifs”**\n\nFor too long, life insurance has been seen as an unnecessary expense, something meant only for the wealthy. This mindset needs to change, insurance is not for the rich; it’s for the wise.\n\nLife insurance ensures that if the unexpected happens, your family will not suffer financially. It covers funeral costs, outstanding debts, and daily expenses, giving your loved ones the security to move forward even in difficult times.\n\nBut beyond death benefits, life insurance is evolving. Modern policies, like those offered by Heirs Insurance Group, provide investment and savings opportunities. With channels such as USSD and mobile apps, insurance has become much closer to the average Nigerian.\n\nWith options such as endowment plans and investment-linked policies, Nigerians can build wealth while staying protected. In a country where formal savings rates are low, insurance-backed financial plans offer a structured way to prepare for the future while enjoying peace of mind.\n\n**So How Much is Your Life Really Worth?**\n\nThe unpredictability of life in Nigeria makes financial planning a necessity, not a luxury. Hope is not a strategy. Ignoring the risks would not make them disappear. The only way to truly secure your future and the future of those you love is by taking action today.\n\nSo, how much is a Nigerian life really worth? The truth is, the value of your life is not just in what you own, but in what you protect. When the unexpected happens, will you leave your future to chance, or will you take control?\n\nThe choice is yours—do you believe your life is worth securing, or will you wait until it’s too late?\n\nChoose wisely."

  "markdown": "# There are Still Numerous Untapped Opportunities for Growth and Innovation in the Insurtech Space\n\n**By: Wole Fayemi, MD/CEO Heirs General Insurance**\n\nIn an era where technology is reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace, the untapped potential for innovation in Africa’s fintech sector looms large, especially in the insurance industry. With two decades of experience in the broad financial services industry, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of technology in revolutionising the insurance landscape, especially its acceleration in the last decade. However, while there is still a vast vacuum to fill to further integrate insurance and technology to address the needs of Africa’s underserved market, transformation has only just begun. There are still many opportunities for transformation.\n\n**The Current Landscape**\n\nAfrica’s fintech industry is undergoing rapid expansion, propelled by expanding internet connectivity and a young, tech-savvy population whose cultural trends and demands are influencing life and work. However, in the insurance industry, although technology has fuelled most of the transformation in the sector, the impact is minimal. With over 200 million Nigerians not having access to insurance, the outcome of economic uncertainty is more catastrophic if customers suffer a loss.\n\nHence, there are still opportunities for growth and innovation. Two critical areas of focus for innovation include: insurance education and insurance processes.\n\n**Insurance Education**\n\nOne of the primary challenges hindering the integration of insurance and technology in Africa is the lack of awareness and understanding of insurance products among the population. Many individuals are either unaware of insurance benefits or perceive it as inaccessible and unaffordable.\n\nHowever, within this challenge lies a significant opportunity. By leveraging technology to educate and engage consumers, we can demystify insurance, making it a lifestyle choice, affordable and accessible to a broader segment of the population.\n\nFrom mobile apps offering personalised insurance recommendations to chatbots providing real-time assistance and mobile games, education can enhance the customer experience and drive insurance penetration and adoption.\n\n**Harnessing Technology to Accelerate Insurance processes**\n\nThe growth of the financial services industry in the past decade can be attributed to technology adoption. In the insurance space, it is no different. However, opportunities remain largely untapped, especially in leveraging technology to enhance the claims and underwriting processes.\n\nFor instance, in Heirs Insurance Group, we recognise the transformative potential of technology in revolutionizing the insurance industry. This is why we have invested in digital platforms and analytics to better understand our customers’ needs and deliver tailored solutions. Mobile apps such as  SimpleLife enables customers to purchase insurance policies, file claims, and access assistance directly from their smartphones within mere minutes. In addition, InConnect, a partnership platform enabling insurance resales, simplifies processes further, enabling a larger pool of stakeholders to enter the otherwise gated industry.\n\n**Insurtech: The Next Big Thing?**\n\nIn today’s insurance landscape, insurtech plays a pivotal role in driving innovation across Africa’s insurance industry. Pioneers like Heirs Insurance Group are leveraging technology to develop innovative solutions tailored to African consumers’ unique needs, from developing and distributing microinsurance products to low-income individuals to  specialised insurance solutions for different underserved audiences.\n\nBy fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation, we can harness the collective expertise of both traditional and insurtech strategies to drive meaningful change and unlock new opportunities in Africa’s insurance ecosystem.\n\n**Regulatory Considerations**\n\nThe integration of insurance and technology raises crucial regulatory considerations. As technology evolves, policymakers must ensure that regulatory frameworks keep pace to protect consumers while fostering innovation and competition among insurance companies.\n\nThrough close collaboration with regulators, industry stakeholders can create an enabling environment that promotes innovation while safeguarding consumer interests. This includes establishing clear guidelines for data privacy and security and promoting transparency and accountability in technology usage within the insurance industry.\n\nAs Africa’s fintech ecosystem evolves, the integration of insurance and technology presents a significant opportunity to address the needs of uninsured population across the continent. By leveraging technology to innovate and collaborate, we can unlock new opportunities, drive financial inclusion through individuals and SMEs, and improve the lives of millions.\n\n**About Wole Fayemi**\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in insurance operations, Wole Fayemi leads Heirs General Insurance, the non-life business of Heirs Insurance Group, as MD/CEO.\n\nHeirs Insurance Group is a leading digital-first insurance organisation transforming the insurance sector."

  "markdown": "# The Game-Changing Trends Shaping Africa’s Insurance Revolution\n\n_An Interview with Peace Okhianmhense-_Philips_– Chief Digital Officer, Heirs Insurance Group_\n\nIn 2025, Africa’s insurtech landscape is poised for a transformative leap, driven by rapid technological advancements and a burgeoning demand for accessible insurance solutions. The continent’s insurance market, valued at approximately USD 92.9 billion in 2024, is projected to reach USD 160.9 billion by 2033, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.03%\n\nThis growth is primarily driven by factors like increasing mobile penetration, rising digitalization, and a growing demand for innovative insurance solutions tailored to the African market (to bridge the existing protection gap).\n\nDespite this substantial market size, insurance penetration remains low across many African nations, signaling immense growth potential. Africa’s insurance penetration rate is low, averaging around 3% compared to the global average of 6.1%. This indicates a vast untapped market ripe for insurtech innovation.\n\nMr.Peace Okhianmhense- Philips, the Chief Digital Officer of Heirs Insurance Group shared some thoughts on the game-changing trends that will shape Africa’s insurance sector in 2025 and beyond.\n\n**The game-changing trends shaping** **insurtech**\n\n“In 2025, AI takes centerstage globally and this will also cascade to the African continent. The insurance industry is not left out. Insurtech will thrive with innovations such as AI-powered virtual assistants that will streamline customer interactions and resolve basic complaints, as well as enhance claims experience with Claims BOTs. In addition, the industry will record AI chatbots that will assist companies in delivering seamless digital channels that reach all demographics”, Mr. Okhianmhense-Philips said.\n\nHe added, “Partnerships will remain vital for industry growth, allowing insurers to reach diverse demographics through collaborations with telecom providers, fintech platforms, and digital ecosystems. At Heirs Insurance Group, we have taken up the challenge of democratizing access to insurance by introducing digital platforms that achieve this, such as \\*1100#, our USSD platform, which enables policy renewals for individuals without internet access, and our chatbot, Prince, which helps customers solve quick customer queries via WhatsApp.”\n\n**How can stakeholders should prepare and leverage these trends**\n\nMr. Okhianmhense-Philips enjoined industry players to prioritise investments in inclusive technologies such as offline-capable services and AI-driven tools to bridge accessibility gaps. He remarked that strong partnerships with telecom providers and fintech platforms are essential to expanding reach and improving operational efficiency. A focus on customer-centric innovations, such as embedded micro-insurance, will further enhance insurance penetration.\n\n**The most exciting Insurtech innovations that will gain momentum**\n\nAs we navigate through 2025, the convergence of technology and insurance in Africa is set to redefine risk management and protection, making insurance more accessible and tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities within the continent.\n\nMr. Okhianmhense-Philips has this to say: “The integration of AI in insurance is revolutionising the sector by enhancing efficiency, personalisation, and accessibility. At Heirs Insurance Group, our Smart Chatbot, Prince, is a prime example of this transformation. Prince allows customers to conveniently renew policies via WhatsApp, with plans to blend cutting-edge AI for unmatched convenience. These innovations are setting new standards for accessibility, making it easier for customers to engage with insurance services anytime, anywhere.”\n\n**Insurance is more accessible and affordable with technology**\n\nAs digital transformation accelerates, insurtech startups are not only reshaping traditional insurance models but also enhancing accessibility and affordability for underserved communities across the continent.\n\nAccording to Mr. Okhianmhense-Philips, “Technology has democratised insurance in Africa, bridging gaps in accessibility and affordability. As digital ecosystems expand, insurtech startups are leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and IoT technologies to offer personalized, efficient, and customer-centric insurance products. This digital transformation is not only enhancing customer experience but also driving operational efficiency across the insurance value chain.”\n\nHe stated further, “For example, Heirs Insurance Group’s \\*1100# USSD platform empowers customers in rural areas without internet access to renew their policies seamlessly. Similarly, there are platforms that offer innovative, low-cost plans tailored to low-income earners, promoting financial inclusion. These solutions ensure that a wider audience can access insurance services, regardless of their location or income level.”\n\nHe advised innovators and entrepreneurs in your sector looking to succeed in 2025 to embrace partnerships as a pathway to scale and innovate. He added that “Collaborations with the digital ecosystem, including telecom providers, fintech platforms will help expand reach and enhance service delivery. Focus on solving real challenges, such as access and affordability, by leveraging transformative tools like embedded insurance, AI-driven solutions, and digital channels.”\n\nMr. Okhianmhense-Philips asked key players to prioritise a culture of data-driven insights to understand customer needs and develop tailored products. “Data is definitely king in this transformation agenda. A customer-first approach, combined with innovative, scalable solutions, will be the key to thriving in 2025 and beyond,” he observed.\n\nHe concluded by saying, “Educating and upskilling in emerging technologies will be an essential factor in guaranteeing success for key players in the insurance industry. This rapid expansion is fueled by the rise of microinsurance, climate risk solutions, and the integration of artificial intelligence, all tailored to meet the unique needs of the African populace.”\n\n_Source: [Tech Trends Africa](https://techtrends.africa/the-game-changing-trends-shaping-africas-insurance-revolution/)_"

He made this charge while addressing graduates of the Institute and delivering the keynote speech at the 2022 Induction and Award ceremony of the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN) on Wednesday, December 7, 2022, at the College of Insurance Financial Management in Ogun State.  \n\nOnifade joined the President/Chairman of Council, Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria, Mr. Edwin Igbiti, past council presidents and other dignitaries at the auspicious ceremony, celebrating over 150 newly inducted chartered professionals.\n\nSpeaking on the topic “The Professional: Key Player to a Sustainable Insurance Industry,” Onifade congratulated the new inductees and awardees, highlighting the significant role insurance professionals play in sustaining the economy.\n\n![](https://newscorner.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Niyi-Onifade-Calls-for-Urgency-in-Grooming-the-Next-Generation-of-Insurance-Professionals-at-CIIN-Induction-and-Award-Ceremony-scaled.jpg)\n\nAccording to him, “The insurance professional is one of the most essential professionals in the context of the global economy. We play a key role in sustaining the economy by protecting the means of livelihood of millions of people – both in terms of lives and possessions.”\n\nHe charged the inductees to be good ambassadors of the profession by upholding the code of ethics and acting with the highest professional standards and integrity. He added that the new status comes with certain responsibilities and expectations, imploring them to adhere to relevant laws and regulations governing the affairs of the industry.\n\nSpeaking on transformation, Onifade made a case for a joint vision statement by the insurance industry. According to him, underwriters need to do more to encourage Nigerians to adopt insurance as a lifestyle.\n\nHe said: “I would like to advocate for the adoption of a common Vision Statement for our industry. I recommend an industry Vision Statement that reads like this: “To make insurance a lifestyle in Nigeria.” This should be adopted by all our industry players – insurance companies, brokers, loss adjusters etc. When insurance becomes a lifestyle, every Nigerian would remember to add insurance premium to his budget list.”\n\nHe concluded by commending the efforts of the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN), and industry bodies such as the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) and National Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB), towards deepening insurance penetration in the country but called for more efforts across board. “We are very proud of the great work that the Commissioner for Insurance, Mr. O. S. Thomas, and his team are doing to change the face of our industry. Industry bodies are also doing well in this respect, but so much remains to be done. We need to do more, and we can do more, as an industry.”\n\nA Fellow of both the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria and London, Niyi Onifade has three decades of cognate experience in insurance and pension management. He is a multiple award winner and became the first Nigerian (and the second African) to bag the coveted Rutter Medal Award of the Chartered Insurance Institute, London, in 2003.\n\n##### Share This :\n\n## Related Post\n\n## We’re human, above all else\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, you are our priority.

It is usually a small amount, compared to what Heirs General Insurance will pay. It is your way of accepting some responsibility to keep your property safe. When you have a claim, the fixed amount and the percentage option will be assessed. You will be required to pay the higher of the two. However, to avoid Excess charges on your claim, you have the option to buy the excess back at the start of the policy.\n\n**Excess Buy Back**, therefore, is the money you pay to cover up for the excess charge at the inception of a policy which is between 0.5% -1% of the value of the car. Always check your policy document for the terms of your cover.\n\n## We’re human, above all else\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, you are our priority.

  "markdown": "# Niyi Onifade: Meet the man behind one of Nigeria’s fastest-growing insurance companies\n\nFor many Nigerians, insurance has always been that thing you know you should care about, but somehow never do, until disaster strikes. It has lived quietly on the margins of everyday life, treated as optional, distant or even unnecessary.\n\nYet when homes burn, cars are wrecked, or medical emergencies erupt, it is the absence of insurance that pushes families into crisis.\n\nAt the forefront of changing that perception is Niyi Onifade, CEO of Heirs Life Assurance, a member of Heirs Insurance Group, Nigeria’s fastest-growing insurance group. A seasoned Chartered Insurer with over three decades of experience in financial services, Onifade joined Heirs Insurance in 2015 as its pioneering CEO, helping build the company from the ground up.\n\nIn 2020, he became the first MD/CEO of Heirs Life Assurance, leading its successful launch and positioning the firm as a trailblazer in Nigeria’s insurance space through innovation and customer-focused solutions.\n\nToday, he provides strategic leadership across the Heirs Insurance Group, driving synergy, transformation, and performance, all while championing the mission to democratise insurance across Africa.\n\nTo read the full interview on Business Insider Africa, click [here](https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/leaders/niyi-onifade-meet-the-man-behind-one-of-nigerias-fastest-growing-insurance-companies/4s2j8xd)."

  "markdown": "# Tips for Choosing the Right Insurance Company in Nigeria\n\nFor many Nigerians, insurance still feels complicated. You hear stories of people paying premiums but struggling to get claims when it matters. Some say it is only for “big companies.” Others feel unsure about which insurer to trust.\n\nThe truth is: insurance is one of the smartest ways to protect yourself from risks you might not be budgeting for, such as accidents, hospital bills, or damage to your property. But choosing the right insurance company makes all the difference between peace of mind and frustration.\n\n**Here are 5 practical tips to guide you:**\n\n1.  **Pick a Company That Pays Claims…and Pays Fast**\n\nMany Nigerians hesitate to buy insurance because they fear they will not get paid when a problem happens.

  "markdown": "# How Much Is a Nigerian Life Really Worth?\n\n_Written by – Reynold Ibe, Head, Product Development & Innovation, Heirs Insurance Group_\n\nLiving in Nigeria comes with a unique set of challenges. Every day, millions of Nigerians wake up to face a day filled with difficult choices and encounters: rising costs of goods, threats on the roads, a weak healthcare system, and income insecurity. It begets the question: how much is my life really worth, and how can I make my life more valuable?\n\nNigeria’s economy remains largely cash-driven, with over 60% of money in circulation existing outside the formal banking system, according to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This means that most Nigerians operate without structured financial safety nets, leaving them and their families exposed to sudden financial crises. Add to this the country’s alarmingly high mortality rates: 117 per 1,000 live births for children under five and a maternal mortality rate of 512 per 100,000 live births (World Bank), and the reality becomes clear: life is fragile, unpredictable, and often cut short too soon.\n\nIf an emergency struck today, how prepared are you? If something happened to you, would your family be financially secure? These are not just theoretical questions; they demand real, immediate answers.\n\n**The Cost of Inaction**\n\nDespite the many undeniable benefits of life insurance, only 1.9% of Nigerians have any form of insurance, according to the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM). This low adoption rate is due to a lack of awareness, cultural perceptions, and affordability concerns. But think about it—if an unexpected event wipes out everything you’ve worked for, will your regrets be worth it?\n\nInstead of asking whether you can afford life insurance, ask yourself if you can afford NOT to have it.\n\n**Why Nigerians Must Take Action Now**\n\nOne of the biggest financial risks Nigerians face is the cost of healthcare. Quality medical treatment remains unaffordable for many, forcing families to delay treatment or seek subpar alternatives. In a country where social security is weak and government assistance is limited, the reality is stark: one health crisis could mean financial ruin.\n\nAnd yet, millions of Nigerians continue to live without a financial backup plan. Many prioritise short-term expenses over long-term security. But when a crisis comes—whether it is an accident, illness, or even death—who bears the burden? Would your loved ones have to struggle or depend on charity just to survive?\n\n**Life Insurance: The Answer to Your “What Ifs”**\n\nFor too long, life insurance has been seen as an unnecessary expense, something meant only for the wealthy. This mindset needs to change, insurance is not for the rich; it’s for the wise.\n\nLife insurance ensures that if the unexpected happens, your family will not suffer financially. It covers funeral costs, outstanding debts, and daily expenses, giving your loved ones the security to move forward even in difficult times.\n\nBut beyond death benefits, life insurance is evolving. Modern policies, like those offered by Heirs Insurance Group, provide investment and savings opportunities. With channels such as USSD and mobile apps, insurance has become much closer to the average Nigerian.\n\nWith options such as endowment plans and investment-linked policies, Nigerians can build wealth while staying protected. In a country where formal savings rates are low, insurance-backed financial plans offer a structured way to prepare for the future while enjoying peace of mind.\n\n**So How Much is Your Life Really Worth?**\n\nThe unpredictability of life in Nigeria makes financial planning a necessity, not a luxury. Hope is not a strategy. Ignoring the risks would not make them disappear. The only way to truly secure your future and the future of those you love is by taking action today.\n\nSo, how much is a Nigerian life really worth? The truth is, the value of your life is not just in what you own, but in what you protect. When the unexpected happens, will you leave your future to chance, or will you take control?\n\nThe choice is yours—do you believe your life is worth securing, or will you wait until it’s too late?\n\nChoose wisely."

  "markdown": "# Top 3 Insurance Companies in Nigeria Leading Digital Innovation in 2025\n\nFor decades, the word “insurance” in Nigeria was often met with side-eyes and shrugs, a concept many considered foreign, unnecessary, or at best, a last resort. Stories of unfulfilled claims and endless paperwork left a sour taste in the mouths of everyday Nigerians. But slowly, something is changing.\n\nToday, more Nigerians are warming up to the idea of protecting what matters, be it their health, homes, businesses, or future, with insurance. And this shift is not just a matter of improved awareness. It is also a digital story.\n\nIn an age where convenience is king, a new crop of insurance companies is rewriting the playbook. From user-friendly mobile apps and AI-powered chatbots to seamless online claims and payment platforms, these companies are meeting Nigerians where they are: on their phones, at their fingertips, and on their terms.\n\nSo, what companies are leading this quiet but powerful revolution?\n\nLet us take a closer look at the top insurance companies in Nigeria that are combining digital ingenuity with financial strength making protection accessible, through innovation, trust, and technology.\n\n1.  **Axa Mansard:**\n\nAXA Mansard has long been seen as one of the pioneers of digital insurance in Nigeria, and the company continues to evolve its offerings to meet the needs of today’s digital-first consumer. Its mobile app, MyAxa Plus, offers customers the ability to manage health plans, book hospital visits, and access insurance support, all in one place.\n\nThe app has recorded over 100,000 downloads, reflecting its popularity among customers seeking a convenient insurance experience. Beyond health, AXA’s digital platform supports other insurance purchases with just a few taps, enabling customers to get covered without setting foot in a branch.\n\n2.  [**Heirs Insurance Group:**](https://heirsinsurancegroup.com/)\n\nHeirs Insurance Group earned the title of Nigeria’s fastest-growing insurance Group due to its rapid financial growth and the initiatives it has pioneered since its launch in 2021. The insurance group is reshaping how everyday Nigerians access insurance through innovation and technology.\n\nAt the centre of its digital ecosystem is its mobile app with the cheeky name, SimpleLife, which allows users to buy a wide range of insurance policies including motor, travel, life insurance and more, as well as file claims easily. The app has recorded over 70,000 downloads on iOS and Android.\n\nThis is supported by other user-friendly tools, including an AI-powered WhatsApp chatbot it calls Prince; a USSD code for quick access to insurance; and what it calls Nigeria’s first digital insurance experience centre for walk-in convenience.\n\nAccording to a report, in 2024, the Group recorded a 200% increase in revenue from its digital channels when compared to the same period in 2024. This proves the effectiveness of its tech-led model and consumers’ willingness to utilise digital channels for insurance.\n\n3.  **Leadway Assurance:**\n\nLeadway Assurance is successfully blending its decades-long legacy with modern technology to deliver value to a new generation of customers. The Leadway App, available on major app stores, enables users to access and manage a wide range of insurance products, from motor to investment-linked plans.\n\nWith over 50,000 app downloads, Leadway continues to invest in digital upgrades that simplify everything from policy purchase to claims tracking. The company also integrates digital customer service and chat support on its website and social media, making help accessible without queues or delays.\n\nIts digital strategy also includes financial literacy content and tools that help users better understand insurance, turning what was once a complex subject into everyday conversation.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nFrom mobile apps to AI assistants, Nigeria’s leading insurance companies are proving that the future of insurance lies in simplicity, speed, and digital access. With each of these three companies making it easier to get covered, file claims, and stay protected, insurance in Nigeria is no longer a luxury or mystery, but a service just a tap away.\n\nFor Nigerians looking to insure their lives, cars, health, or homes, the message is clear: there is an app for that, and the experience is getting better every day.\n\n**_Originally published by Naira Metrics._**"

  "markdown": "# How an Insurance Company Is Using Entertainment to Promote Insurance Education in Africa\n\nWhen Suits, the globally acclaimed American television series hit the screens in 2011, no one could have predicted the cultural phenomenon it would become. Centered around the glamorous world of corporate attorneys and set against the fast-paced backdrop of New York’s legal battleground, Suits took what many considered a dull profession and transformed it into prime-time magic.\n\nThe success of Suits proved quite clearly that any industry, no matter how traditionally unglamorous and ambiguous it has been perceived, can be made interesting when it is presented through emotional depth and cultural relevance.\n\nMy love for Suits amplified my excitement when I learned that Heirs Insurance Group was developing the first-ever insurance web series in Africa. It’s objective: to promote insurance education and drive insurance penetration in Nigeria and across the continent.\n\nThe reasons behind the project are stark: insurance penetration in Nigeria is less than 1% and across Africa, less than 3%, far less global averages. On a continent with a higher low-middle class, it is paradoxical that insurance is not a default for everyone.\n\nThe project objective was ambitious. It was, therefore, both refreshing and inspiring to see Heirs Insurance Group take such a bold and creative step, leveraging entertainment, particularly film, to educate, inform, and spark interest in an industry that is not quite understood or readily accepted by the masses.\n\n**The Underwriters: Where Insurance Meets Entertainment**\n\nAt first glance, pairing insurance with filmmaking feels like seeing a ballerina walk into a boxing ring; two worlds that rarely intersect. Surprisingly, [Heirs Insurance Group](http://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/) pulled it off.\n\nLaunched in the tail end of 2024, their film series tagged “[The Underwriters](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKzX6UG7Pf2mz_107GUXMtkXPsHThxHKx)” took the digital space by surprise, quickly amassing hundreds of thousands of views across YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook within the first month of premiering. It told a simple love story set in an insurance company but with the lives of everyday people woven intricately to educate the audience of the importance of insurance.\n\nBut more than the numbers, what truly stood out was how deeply the show resonated with its viewers. Real-life scenarios rooted in everyday realities, told the story of how truly relevant insurance could be if more people understood and embraced it.\n\nOne of the major hindrances to insurance penetration in Nigeria is the widely held perception that the profession is meant for the “experts” or highly knowledgeable people. However, Heirs Insurance Group did the unexpected: they plugged into the African love for exciting and emotionally engaging motion pictures, reimagining insurance and demystifying stereotypes, while also entertaining the audience.\n\nIn the same way, Suits made corporate law thrilling by humanising its characters and placing the audience in the high-stakes decisions of legal professionals, “The Underwriters” does the same with insurance. It does not just dramatise policy sales or claim settlements, it brings them to life, making the viewers experience the everyday life of an insurance professional. With the project, people could finally understand what insurance meant for everyone.\n\n**Creativity with Intentionality**\n\nWhat made “The Underwriters” an instant hit is the intentionality. The web series was not a random idea thrown together in a boardroom. It was the product of a bold strategy by Heirs Insurance Group to reinvent how insurance is perceived, especially by younger, digitally native Africans.\n\nThe objective was to make insurance a lifestyle and present its value in a simple and understandable manner. Dismantling the many myths around insurance, like the notion that insurers never pay claims or that insurance is only for the wealthy and educated, or for the religious, the notion of faith answering all, Heirs Insurance Group was intentional in making sure the series serves both as a brand-building tool and a platform for public enlightenment and awareness.\n\n**Meeting the Market Where It Is – The Power of Digital Know-how**\n\nIn today’s world, the audience wants to be served at the comforts of their devices. They would rather binge-watch a web series on YouTube or scroll through reels on Instagram. This is where Heirs Insurance has shown true creativity. Rather than wait for the market to come to them, they have gone to the market in its language, on its platforms, and through its cultural lenses. The series is available online, so anyone anywhere can watch.\n\nAnd the results speak for themselves. With nearly 200k views, the web series has sparked real conversations, prompting questions and comments around insurance.\n\nSome of the comments from viewers include:\n\n*   _“Breathtaking mindset, I love it trust me._\n*   _First insurance movie in the federation and industry as a whole…_\n*   _“This was an interesting watch. What better way to learn about insurance and be entertained while at it”_\n*   From far away, Zimbabwe, one viewer said, _“I’m a Claims Examiner in Zimbabwe, and I am enjoying the series. Well done team._\n\nHeirs Insurance Group is not just trying to market products, it is overhauling mindsets. By tapping into entertainment, the Group has managed to change the tone of the industry, from cold to cool, from aloof to approachable and inclusive. And in a space where so many brands are fighting for attention, this makes all the difference.\n\nIn the end, The Underwriters is not just a clever piece of communication, it is a bold declaration that insurance can be as much a part of your lifestyle as your fashion choices or streaming preferences.\n\n_Originally published on [Business Insider](https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/how-an-insurance-company-is-using-entertainment-to-promote-insurance-education-in/smnpm7l)_"

  "markdown": "# How does Life Insurance work?\n\nImagine your loved ones waking up tomorrow without your income. What would change immediately? Rent, school fees, daily food, or medical bills?\n\nIt is a tough question, but a necessary one. For many Nigerians, the loss of one person’s income can shake an entire household. That is why more people are beginning to explore something called [**life insurance**](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/), or [**life assurance**](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/), depending on what you call it. Both terms refer to the same idea: putting a financial plan in place so your family can carry on if the unexpected happens to you.\n\n**So, what is Life Insurance (or Life Assurance)?**\n\nIn simple terms, it is a way of saying, “If I am not here to provide for my family, I still want them to be okay. With a life insurance plan,  especially a [term life plan](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/), you set aside a small amount of money now, so that if anything happens to you, your family receives a payout that helps them stay afloat. Think of it as income replacement. If you earn money today and your family depends on you, life insurance acts as a financial cushion for them if you are no longer around to earn that income.\n\n**Why do you need Life Insurance?**\n\nYou need life insurance because your family depends on your income and finances to take care of them. Grief is hard enough; it should not come with extra financial struggle.\n\n**Which Life Insurance Plan Should You Choose?**\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, there are two types of life insurance plans you can consider, depending on your needs:  \n**[Term Life Plan](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/) and [Whole Life Plan](https://live-hla-website.prod.heirsinsurance.com/whole-life).**\n\nLet us break them down.\n\n1.  **[Term Life Insurance Plan](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/)**\n\n**Best for:** People looking for affordable, short-term protection.  \nThink: Budget-friendly coverage for when you are actively earning and supporting others.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   You pay from as little as ₦1,000 per year\n*   You choose the payout amount your family should receive (₦100,000 and above)\n*   You must be between 18 and 64 years old\n*   The plan lasts one year minimum, and can be renewed annually\n*   If anything happens to you within the active term, your family receives the full payout.\n\nThis plan is great if you want peace of mind and want to protect your family during your most financially active years.\n\n2.  **[Whole Life Insurance Plan](https://live-hla-website.prod.heirsinsurance.com/whole-life)**\n\n**Best for:** People who want to leave an inheritance, plan long-term, or ensure their family always gets something, no matter when they pass away.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   You choose the amount you want your family to inherit\n*   The plan is valid for life\n*   You can pay monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, annually, or even once\n*   You must be between 18 and 60 years old\n*   Payment can stop at a set age (45, 50, 55, or 60), but coverage continues for life\n\nNo matter when you pass away, this plan guarantees your family will receive a payout.\n\n**What happens when you have life insurance?**\n\n*   Your children can stay in school.\n*   Your spouse will not have to start over from scratch.\n*   Your siblings or parents can get the support they need.\n*   Your legacy becomes one of protection, not panic.\n\nWhether you call it **life assurance** or **life insurance**, it is really just about protecting the people who matter most to you. It is not for the rich. It is not just for older people. It is thoughtful. It is responsible. It is something we should talk about more.

  "markdown": "# There are Still Numerous Untapped Opportunities for Growth and Innovation in the Insurtech Space\n\n**By: Wole Fayemi, MD/CEO Heirs General Insurance**\n\nIn an era where technology is reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace, the untapped potential for innovation in Africa’s fintech sector looms large, especially in the insurance industry. With two decades of experience in the broad financial services industry, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of technology in revolutionising the insurance landscape, especially its acceleration in the last decade. However, while there is still a vast vacuum to fill to further integrate insurance and technology to address the needs of Africa’s underserved market, transformation has only just begun. There are still many opportunities for transformation.\n\n**The Current Landscape**\n\nAfrica’s fintech industry is undergoing rapid expansion, propelled by expanding internet connectivity and a young, tech-savvy population whose cultural trends and demands are influencing life and work. However, in the insurance industry, although technology has fuelled most of the transformation in the sector, the impact is minimal. With over 200 million Nigerians not having access to insurance, the outcome of economic uncertainty is more catastrophic if customers suffer a loss.\n\nHence, there are still opportunities for growth and innovation. Two critical areas of focus for innovation include: insurance education and insurance processes.\n\n**Insurance Education**\n\nOne of the primary challenges hindering the integration of insurance and technology in Africa is the lack of awareness and understanding of insurance products among the population. Many individuals are either unaware of insurance benefits or perceive it as inaccessible and unaffordable.\n\nHowever, within this challenge lies a significant opportunity. By leveraging technology to educate and engage consumers, we can demystify insurance, making it a lifestyle choice, affordable and accessible to a broader segment of the population.\n\nFrom mobile apps offering personalised insurance recommendations to chatbots providing real-time assistance and mobile games, education can enhance the customer experience and drive insurance penetration and adoption.\n\n**Harnessing Technology to Accelerate Insurance processes**\n\nThe growth of the financial services industry in the past decade can be attributed to technology adoption. In the insurance space, it is no different. However, opportunities remain largely untapped, especially in leveraging technology to enhance the claims and underwriting processes.\n\nFor instance, in Heirs Insurance Group, we recognise the transformative potential of technology in revolutionizing the insurance industry. This is why we have invested in digital platforms and analytics to better understand our customers’ needs and deliver tailored solutions. Mobile apps such as  SimpleLife enables customers to purchase insurance policies, file claims, and access assistance directly from their smartphones within mere minutes. In addition, InConnect, a partnership platform enabling insurance resales, simplifies processes further, enabling a larger pool of stakeholders to enter the otherwise gated industry.\n\n**Insurtech: The Next Big Thing?**\n\nIn today’s insurance landscape, insurtech plays a pivotal role in driving innovation across Africa’s insurance industry. Pioneers like Heirs Insurance Group are leveraging technology to develop innovative solutions tailored to African consumers’ unique needs, from developing and distributing microinsurance products to low-income individuals to  specialised insurance solutions for different underserved audiences.\n\nBy fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation, we can harness the collective expertise of both traditional and insurtech strategies to drive meaningful change and unlock new opportunities in Africa’s insurance ecosystem.\n\n**Regulatory Considerations**\n\nThe integration of insurance and technology raises crucial regulatory considerations. As technology evolves, policymakers must ensure that regulatory frameworks keep pace to protect consumers while fostering innovation and competition among insurance companies.\n\nThrough close collaboration with regulators, industry stakeholders can create an enabling environment that promotes innovation while safeguarding consumer interests. This includes establishing clear guidelines for data privacy and security and promoting transparency and accountability in technology usage within the insurance industry.\n\nAs Africa’s fintech ecosystem evolves, the integration of insurance and technology presents a significant opportunity to address the needs of uninsured population across the continent. By leveraging technology to innovate and collaborate, we can unlock new opportunities, drive financial inclusion through individuals and SMEs, and improve the lives of millions.\n\n**About Wole Fayemi**\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in insurance operations, Wole Fayemi leads Heirs General Insurance, the non-life business of Heirs Insurance Group, as MD/CEO.\n\nHeirs Insurance Group is a leading digital-first insurance organisation transforming the insurance sector."

He made this charge while addressing graduates of the Institute and delivering the keynote speech at the 2022 Induction and Award ceremony of the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN) on Wednesday, December 7, 2022, at the College of Insurance Financial Management in Ogun State.  \n\nOnifade joined the President/Chairman of Council, Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria, Mr. Edwin Igbiti, past council presidents and other dignitaries at the auspicious ceremony, celebrating over 150 newly inducted chartered professionals.\n\nSpeaking on the topic “The Professional: Key Player to a Sustainable Insurance Industry,” Onifade congratulated the new inductees and awardees, highlighting the significant role insurance professionals play in sustaining the economy.\n\n![](https://newscorner.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Niyi-Onifade-Calls-for-Urgency-in-Grooming-the-Next-Generation-of-Insurance-Professionals-at-CIIN-Induction-and-Award-Ceremony-scaled.jpg)\n\nAccording to him, “The insurance professional is one of the most essential professionals in the context of the global economy. We play a key role in sustaining the economy by protecting the means of livelihood of millions of people – both in terms of lives and possessions.”\n\nHe charged the inductees to be good ambassadors of the profession by upholding the code of ethics and acting with the highest professional standards and integrity. He added that the new status comes with certain responsibilities and expectations, imploring them to adhere to relevant laws and regulations governing the affairs of the industry.\n\nSpeaking on transformation, Onifade made a case for a joint vision statement by the insurance industry. According to him, underwriters need to do more to encourage Nigerians to adopt insurance as a lifestyle.\n\nHe said: “I would like to advocate for the adoption of a common Vision Statement for our industry. I recommend an industry Vision Statement that reads like this: “To make insurance a lifestyle in Nigeria.” This should be adopted by all our industry players – insurance companies, brokers, loss adjusters etc. When insurance becomes a lifestyle, every Nigerian would remember to add insurance premium to his budget list.”\n\nHe concluded by commending the efforts of the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN), and industry bodies such as the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) and National Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB), towards deepening insurance penetration in the country but called for more efforts across board. “We are very proud of the great work that the Commissioner for Insurance, Mr. O. S. Thomas, and his team are doing to change the face of our industry. Industry bodies are also doing well in this respect, but so much remains to be done. We need to do more, and we can do more, as an industry.”\n\nA Fellow of both the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria and London, Niyi Onifade has three decades of cognate experience in insurance and pension management. He is a multiple award winner and became the first Nigerian (and the second African) to bag the coveted Rutter Medal Award of the Chartered Insurance Institute, London, in 2003.\n\n##### Share This :\n\n## Related Post\n\n## We’re human, above all else\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, you are our priority.

  "markdown": "# The Game-Changing Trends Shaping Africa’s Insurance Revolution\n\n_An Interview with Peace Okhianmhense-_Philips_– Chief Digital Officer, Heirs Insurance Group_\n\nIn 2025, Africa’s insurtech landscape is poised for a transformative leap, driven by rapid technological advancements and a burgeoning demand for accessible insurance solutions. The continent’s insurance market, valued at approximately USD 92.9 billion in 2024, is projected to reach USD 160.9 billion by 2033, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.03%\n\nThis growth is primarily driven by factors like increasing mobile penetration, rising digitalization, and a growing demand for innovative insurance solutions tailored to the African market (to bridge the existing protection gap).\n\nDespite this substantial market size, insurance penetration remains low across many African nations, signaling immense growth potential. Africa’s insurance penetration rate is low, averaging around 3% compared to the global average of 6.1%. This indicates a vast untapped market ripe for insurtech innovation.\n\nMr.Peace Okhianmhense- Philips, the Chief Digital Officer of Heirs Insurance Group shared some thoughts on the game-changing trends that will shape Africa’s insurance sector in 2025 and beyond.\n\n**The game-changing trends shaping** **insurtech**\n\n“In 2025, AI takes centerstage globally and this will also cascade to the African continent. The insurance industry is not left out. Insurtech will thrive with innovations such as AI-powered virtual assistants that will streamline customer interactions and resolve basic complaints, as well as enhance claims experience with Claims BOTs. In addition, the industry will record AI chatbots that will assist companies in delivering seamless digital channels that reach all demographics”, Mr. Okhianmhense-Philips said.\n\nHe added, “Partnerships will remain vital for industry growth, allowing insurers to reach diverse demographics through collaborations with telecom providers, fintech platforms, and digital ecosystems. At Heirs Insurance Group, we have taken up the challenge of democratizing access to insurance by introducing digital platforms that achieve this, such as \\*1100#, our USSD platform, which enables policy renewals for individuals without internet access, and our chatbot, Prince, which helps customers solve quick customer queries via WhatsApp.”\n\n**How can stakeholders should prepare and leverage these trends**\n\nMr. Okhianmhense-Philips enjoined industry players to prioritise investments in inclusive technologies such as offline-capable services and AI-driven tools to bridge accessibility gaps. He remarked that strong partnerships with telecom providers and fintech platforms are essential to expanding reach and improving operational efficiency. A focus on customer-centric innovations, such as embedded micro-insurance, will further enhance insurance penetration.\n\n**The most exciting Insurtech innovations that will gain momentum**\n\nAs we navigate through 2025, the convergence of technology and insurance in Africa is set to redefine risk management and protection, making insurance more accessible and tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities within the continent.\n\nMr. Okhianmhense-Philips has this to say: “The integration of AI in insurance is revolutionising the sector by enhancing efficiency, personalisation, and accessibility. At Heirs Insurance Group, our Smart Chatbot, Prince, is a prime example of this transformation. Prince allows customers to conveniently renew policies via WhatsApp, with plans to blend cutting-edge AI for unmatched convenience. These innovations are setting new standards for accessibility, making it easier for customers to engage with insurance services anytime, anywhere.”\n\n**Insurance is more accessible and affordable with technology**\n\nAs digital transformation accelerates, insurtech startups are not only reshaping traditional insurance models but also enhancing accessibility and affordability for underserved communities across the continent.\n\nAccording to Mr. Okhianmhense-Philips, “Technology has democratised insurance in Africa, bridging gaps in accessibility and affordability. As digital ecosystems expand, insurtech startups are leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and IoT technologies to offer personalized, efficient, and customer-centric insurance products. This digital transformation is not only enhancing customer experience but also driving operational efficiency across the insurance value chain.”\n\nHe stated further, “For example, Heirs Insurance Group’s \\*1100# USSD platform empowers customers in rural areas without internet access to renew their policies seamlessly. Similarly, there are platforms that offer innovative, low-cost plans tailored to low-income earners, promoting financial inclusion. These solutions ensure that a wider audience can access insurance services, regardless of their location or income level.”\n\nHe advised innovators and entrepreneurs in your sector looking to succeed in 2025 to embrace partnerships as a pathway to scale and innovate. He added that “Collaborations with the digital ecosystem, including telecom providers, fintech platforms will help expand reach and enhance service delivery. Focus on solving real challenges, such as access and affordability, by leveraging transformative tools like embedded insurance, AI-driven solutions, and digital channels.”\n\nMr. Okhianmhense-Philips asked key players to prioritise a culture of data-driven insights to understand customer needs and develop tailored products. “Data is definitely king in this transformation agenda. A customer-first approach, combined with innovative, scalable solutions, will be the key to thriving in 2025 and beyond,” he observed.\n\nHe concluded by saying, “Educating and upskilling in emerging technologies will be an essential factor in guaranteeing success for key players in the insurance industry. This rapid expansion is fueled by the rise of microinsurance, climate risk solutions, and the integration of artificial intelligence, all tailored to meet the unique needs of the African populace.”\n\n_Source: [Tech Trends Africa](https://techtrends.africa/the-game-changing-trends-shaping-africas-insurance-revolution/)_"

With a vibrant film sector, a booming music scene, and a flourishing arts and culture environment, it stands as one of the country’s most valuable exports.\n\nFor investors, this sector offers a compelling opportunity to diversify investment portfolios and reap incredible returns. However, the industry is fraught with risks but if managed carefully, the industry is one for savvy investors.\n\nAs the Head of the Creative Sector at Heirs Insurance Group, I have observed that the entertainment industry often overlooks the vital role insurance plays in mitigating risks. While this sector may seem to have little appetite for insurance, it has become essential to recognise how strategic coverage can protect against unforeseen events that could otherwise devastate careers, productions, and businesses.\n\nThe entertainment industry is inherently high-risk, with significant investments in projects that are often subject to unpredictable factors like weather, illness, accidents, and even technology failures. Without the proper insurance coverage, these risks could lead to substantial financial losses, project delays, or even the complete shutdown of production. From film producers to musicians, event organisers to talent agencies, every facet of the industry faces unique risks that can be mitigated through tailored insurance solutions.\n\nToo often, investors in the creative sector resort to taking loans or crowdfunding in times of crisis, such as sickness, cancelled events, theft/damage of high-end equipment, accidents, and sometimes, death, this can be attributed to lack of proper protection plan. Insurance becomes indispensable here, offering much-needed support when it matters most.\n\nExamples of relevant insurance plans include:\n\n**Bond insurance**\n\nBond insurance can offer significant benefits to investors in the Nigerian entertainment industry by providing investors with a layer of financial protection and enhancing the creditworthiness of entertainment projects. The Nigerian entertainment industry, while lucrative, can be volatile. With bond insurance, investors in the sector mitigates risks associated with industry fluctuations, production delays, force majeure and other unforeseen events that could impact revenue and profitability of projects. A solid bond insurance policy will boost investors’ confidence which, in turn, leads to increased investment, more ambitious projects, and a stronger, more resilient Nigerian entertainment sector.\n\n**Event Cancellation Insurance:**\n\nAs Nigeria gears up for “Detty December,” with a host of live concerts and events, the risks associated with such large-scale events—adverse weather, equipment failures, accidents, and even death—become more pronounced. Event insurance mitigates these risks, ensuring that organisers are not left financially stranded by unforeseen disruptions.\n\nFor instance, if a concert is cancelled due to severe weather conditions or health emergencies, event insurance can cover financial losses, including refunds and compensation to vendors. This protection safeguards investors’ interests and helps maintain trust with audiences and partners.\n\n**Personal Accident Insurance**\n\nPersonal accident insurance covers the risk of accidents that result in bodily harm, injuries, disablement or death that might prevent artists from fulfilling their obligations.\n\nThe entertainment industry is heavily reliant on the health and well-being of its talent. Accidents on set or injuries to actors or musicians can derail a major project, resulting in financial loss to investors.\n\nA recent case that comes to mind, is the tragic death of a young, vibrant Nigerian actor and several crew members who died earlier in the year in a boat accident while traveling to Delta State to shoot a movie. The deaths rocked the Nigeria movie industry with concerns raised about the safety of film crew members in the face of unsafe working conditions and inadequate protection plans.\n\n**Liability Insurance**\n\nLiability insurance is crucial for protecting against potential lawsuits, whether from injury on set, damage to rented property, or other liabilities that may arise during production.\n\nThe tragic incident that occurred at Asake’s December 2022 concert in the United Kingdom, which resulted in two deaths and numerous injuries, resulted from a stampede after a mass crowd of fans forced their way into the concert. This event underscored the importance of liability coverage. Liability insurance will cover legal fees and settlements, preserving the financial stability and reputation of the musician and investors.\n\n**Intellectual Property Insurance:** This helps protect against claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property disputes, which are common in a creative industry. Pirates and other illegal marketers profit heavily from movie and music projects, leaving investors with little financial return.\n\n**Group Life Insurance**\n\nGroup life insurance is crucial in the entertainment industry where certain roles, such as stunt performers and on-set crew, involve high risks. This type of life insurance provides financial protection in the event of the sudden death of key personnel, ensuring that the business can continue operations without disruption and investors do not experience significant losses. More importantly, it provides financial succour to the family of the deceased, ensuring that they do not suffer financially after the death of a breadwinner.\n\n**Credit Life Assurance**\n\nCredit Life Assurance is a reducing-term insurance designed for short-term borrowers, typically covering up to five years. For investors in the creative industry who take loans to fund projects, it ensures that in the event of death or permanent disability, insurance pays off the remaining loan balance to the creditor, taking away any burden from the family or company left behind.\n\n**Challenges and the Path Forward**\n\nDespite its benefits, the adoption of insurance in Nigeria’s entertainment sector faces several challenges. These include a lack of awareness about the importance of insurance, the cost of premiums, and the limited availability of tailored insurance products.\n\nTo address these issues, increased education and advocacy are essential. Collaboration between industry associations, government bodies, and insurance companies can help create awareness and develop affordable, industry-specific insurance products.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt is time for the entertainment sector to re-evaluate its approach to risk management. By embracing insurance as a crucial component of their business strategy, industry players can protect their investments, safeguard their projects, and ensure long-term success.\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, the Creative Sector team offers advisory to investors who want to mitigate these risks in the entertainment industry. Our tailored insurance solutions are designed to provide peace of mind and financial security, allowing creativity to flourish without the looming threat of unforeseen disasters.\n\n##### Share This :\n\n## Related Post\n\n## We’re human, above all else\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, you are our priority.

  "markdown": "# How does Life Insurance work?\n\nImagine your loved ones waking up tomorrow without your income. What would change immediately? Rent, school fees, daily food, or medical bills?\n\nIt is a tough question, but a necessary one. For many Nigerians, the loss of one person’s income can shake an entire household. That is why more people are beginning to explore something called [**life insurance**](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/), or [**life assurance**](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/), depending on what you call it. Both terms refer to the same idea: putting a financial plan in place so your family can carry on if the unexpected happens to you.\n\n**So, what is Life Insurance (or Life Assurance)?**\n\nIn simple terms, it is a way of saying, “If I am not here to provide for my family, I still want them to be okay. With a life insurance plan,  especially a [term life plan](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/), you set aside a small amount of money now, so that if anything happens to you, your family receives a payout that helps them stay afloat. Think of it as income replacement. If you earn money today and your family depends on you, life insurance acts as a financial cushion for them if you are no longer around to earn that income.\n\n**Why do you need Life Insurance?**\n\nYou need life insurance because your family depends on your income and finances to take care of them. Grief is hard enough; it should not come with extra financial struggle.\n\n**Which Life Insurance Plan Should You Choose?**\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, there are two types of life insurance plans you can consider, depending on your needs:  \n**[Term Life Plan](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/) and [Whole Life Plan](https://live-hla-website.prod.heirsinsurance.com/whole-life).**\n\nLet us break them down.\n\n1.  **[Term Life Insurance Plan](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/)**\n\n**Best for:** People looking for affordable, short-term protection.  \nThink: Budget-friendly coverage for when you are actively earning and supporting others.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   You pay from as little as ₦1,000 per year\n*   You choose the payout amount your family should receive (₦100,000 and above)\n*   You must be between 18 and 64 years old\n*   The plan lasts one year minimum, and can be renewed annually\n*   If anything happens to you within the active term, your family receives the full payout.\n\nThis plan is great if you want peace of mind and want to protect your family during your most financially active years.\n\n2.  **[Whole Life Insurance Plan](https://live-hla-website.prod.heirsinsurance.com/whole-life)**\n\n**Best for:** People who want to leave an inheritance, plan long-term, or ensure their family always gets something, no matter when they pass away.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   You choose the amount you want your family to inherit\n*   The plan is valid for life\n*   You can pay monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, annually, or even once\n*   You must be between 18 and 60 years old\n*   Payment can stop at a set age (45, 50, 55, or 60), but coverage continues for life\n\nNo matter when you pass away, this plan guarantees your family will receive a payout.\n\n**What happens when you have life insurance?**\n\n*   Your children can stay in school.\n*   Your spouse will not have to start over from scratch.\n*   Your siblings or parents can get the support they need.\n*   Your legacy becomes one of protection, not panic.\n\nWhether you call it **life assurance** or **life insurance**, it is really just about protecting the people who matter most to you. It is not for the rich. It is not just for older people. It is thoughtful. It is responsible. It is something we should talk about more. Life is unpredictable, but you can still give your loved ones something steady to hold on to.\n\n**Want to know more?**\n\nThe [**Heirs Term Life Plan**](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/all-insurance-products/personal-fam/term-life/) is available on MySimpleLife App, or visit [**www.heirsinsurancegroup.com**](https://www.heirsinsurancegroup.com/)**.**\n\nYou do not need to overthink it.

  "markdown": "# Tips for Choosing the Right Insurance Company in Nigeria\n\nFor many Nigerians, insurance still feels complicated. You hear stories of people paying premiums but struggling to get claims when it matters.

With a vibrant film sector, a booming music scene, and a flourishing arts and culture environment, it stands as one of the country’s most valuable exports.\n\nFor investors, this sector offers a compelling opportunity to diversify investment portfolios and reap incredible returns. However, the industry is fraught with risks but if managed carefully, the industry is one for savvy investors.\n\nAs the Head of the Creative Sector at Heirs Insurance Group, I have observed that the entertainment industry often overlooks the vital role insurance plays in mitigating risks. While this sector may seem to have little appetite for insurance, it has become essential to recognise how strategic coverage can protect against unforeseen events that could otherwise devastate careers, productions, and businesses.\n\nThe entertainment industry is inherently high-risk, with significant investments in projects that are often subject to unpredictable factors like weather, illness, accidents, and even technology failures. Without the proper insurance coverage, these risks could lead to substantial financial losses, project delays, or even the complete shutdown of production. From film producers to musicians, event organisers to talent agencies, every facet of the industry faces unique risks that can be mitigated through tailored insurance solutions.\n\nToo often, investors in the creative sector resort to taking loans or crowdfunding in times of crisis, such as sickness, cancelled events, theft/damage of high-end equipment, accidents, and sometimes, death, this can be attributed to lack of proper protection plan. Insurance becomes indispensable here, offering much-needed support when it matters most.\n\nExamples of relevant insurance plans include:\n\n**Bond insurance**\n\nBond insurance can offer significant benefits to investors in the Nigerian entertainment industry by providing investors with a layer of financial protection and enhancing the creditworthiness of entertainment projects. The Nigerian entertainment industry, while lucrative, can be volatile. With bond insurance, investors in the sector mitigates risks associated with industry fluctuations, production delays, force majeure and other unforeseen events that could impact revenue and profitability of projects. A solid bond insurance policy will boost investors’ confidence which, in turn, leads to increased investment, more ambitious projects, and a stronger, more resilient Nigerian entertainment sector.\n\n**Event Cancellation Insurance:**\n\nAs Nigeria gears up for “Detty December,” with a host of live concerts and events, the risks associated with such large-scale events—adverse weather, equipment failures, accidents, and even death—become more pronounced. Event insurance mitigates these risks, ensuring that organisers are not left financially stranded by unforeseen disruptions.\n\nFor instance, if a concert is cancelled due to severe weather conditions or health emergencies, event insurance can cover financial losses, including refunds and compensation to vendors. This protection safeguards investors’ interests and helps maintain trust with audiences and partners.\n\n**Personal Accident Insurance**\n\nPersonal accident insurance covers the risk of accidents that result in bodily harm, injuries, disablement or death that might prevent artists from fulfilling their obligations.\n\nThe entertainment industry is heavily reliant on the health and well-being of its talent. Accidents on set or injuries to actors or musicians can derail a major project, resulting in financial loss to investors.\n\nA recent case that comes to mind, is the tragic death of a young, vibrant Nigerian actor and several crew members who died earlier in the year in a boat accident while traveling to Delta State to shoot a movie. The deaths rocked the Nigeria movie industry with concerns raised about the safety of film crew members in the face of unsafe working conditions and inadequate protection plans.\n\n**Liability Insurance**\n\nLiability insurance is crucial for protecting against potential lawsuits, whether from injury on set, damage to rented property, or other liabilities that may arise during production.\n\nThe tragic incident that occurred at Asake’s December 2022 concert in the United Kingdom, which resulted in two deaths and numerous injuries, resulted from a stampede after a mass crowd of fans forced their way into the concert. This event underscored the importance of liability coverage. Liability insurance will cover legal fees and settlements, preserving the financial stability and reputation of the musician and investors.\n\n**Intellectual Property Insurance:** This helps protect against claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property disputes, which are common in a creative industry. Pirates and other illegal marketers profit heavily from movie and music projects, leaving investors with little financial return.\n\n**Group Life Insurance**\n\nGroup life insurance is crucial in the entertainment industry where certain roles, such as stunt performers and on-set crew, involve high risks. This type of life insurance provides financial protection in the event of the sudden death of key personnel, ensuring that the business can continue operations without disruption and investors do not experience significant losses. More importantly, it provides financial succour to the family of the deceased, ensuring that they do not suffer financially after the death of a breadwinner.\n\n**Credit Life Assurance**\n\nCredit Life Assurance is a reducing-term insurance designed for short-term borrowers, typically covering up to five years. For investors in the creative industry who take loans to fund projects, it ensures that in the event of death or permanent disability, insurance pays off the remaining loan balance to the creditor, taking away any burden from the family or company left behind.\n\n**Challenges and the Path Forward**\n\nDespite its benefits, the adoption of insurance in Nigeria’s entertainment sector faces several challenges. These include a lack of awareness about the importance of insurance, the cost of premiums, and the limited availability of tailored insurance products.\n\nTo address these issues, increased education and advocacy are essential. Collaboration between industry associations, government bodies, and insurance companies can help create awareness and develop affordable, industry-specific insurance products.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt is time for the entertainment sector to re-evaluate its approach to risk management. By embracing insurance as a crucial component of their business strategy, industry players can protect their investments, safeguard their projects, and ensure long-term success.\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, the Creative Sector team offers advisory to investors who want to mitigate these risks in the entertainment industry. Our tailored insurance solutions are designed to provide peace of mind and financial security, allowing creativity to flourish without the looming threat of unforeseen disasters.\n\n##### Share This :\n\n## Related Post\n\n## We’re human, above all else\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, you are our priority.

If you are sick and get admitted into the hospital, we will pay you a lump sum of money to cushion the loss of income you might suffer for the period you cannot go to work.\n\nThe Hospital Cash Plan pays you up to a maximum of N200,000 depending on your plan, when you get hospitalised for a minimum of 3 days. This way, you don’t lose income while you’re admitted at the hospital.\n\n##### Already insured?  \nHeirs takes care of everything.\n\nSign up to Heirs and our team will do the rest.\n\nWe guarantee a seamless transition from your former contract to your new Heirs contract, without double coverage or risk of interruption.\n\n![](https://heirsinsurancegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hosital.jpg)\n\n#### SHARE :\n\n### Basic Plan\n\n### Everyone\n\n### ₦600\n\n*   18 - 64 yrs\n*   Hospital Treatment Benefit: Min: N20,000 / Max: N50,000\n*   Life Insurance (Financial support provided to your beneficiary if there's loss of life): Min: N100,000 / Max: N200,000\n*   Payment Frequency: Annually\n*   Waiting Period (Applies to illness only): 15 days after taking the policy / Minimum of 3 nights after hospitalization.\n*   Duration Covered:1year\n\n_Exclusions:_\n\n*   _Pre-existing conditions._\n*   _Hospitalisation for pregnancy, maternity, and fertility-related treatments._\n*   _Cosmetic treatments, plastic surgery, refractive error corrective procedures, experimental, investigational, or unproven procedures or treatments._\n*   _Hospitalization for self-inflicted injuries._\n\n### Intermediate Plan\n\n### Everyone\n\n### ₦1,500\n\n*   18 - 64 yrs\n*   Hospital Treatment Benefit: Min: N50,000 / Max: N100,000\n*   Life Insurance (Financial support provided to your beneficiary if there's loss of life): Min: N200,000 / Max: N500,000\n*   Payment Frequency: Annually\n*   Waiting Period (Applies to illness only): 15 days after taking the policy / Minimum of 3 nights after hospitalization.\n*   Duration Covered:1year\n\n_Exclusions:_\n\n*   _Pre-existing conditions._\n*   _Hospitalisation for pregnancy, maternity, and fertility-related treatments._\n*   _Cosmetic treatments, plastic surgery, refractive error corrective procedures, experimental, investigational, or unproven procedures or treatments._\n*   _Hospitalization for self-inflicted injuries._\n\n### Advanced Plan\n\n### Everyone\n\n### ₦2,800\n\n*   18 - 64 yrs\n*   Hospital Treatment Benefit: Min: N100,000 / Max: N200,000\n*   Life Insurance (Financial support provided to your beneficiary if there's loss of life): Min: N500,000 / Max: N1 Million\n*   Payment Frequency: Monthly, Quarterly, or Annually\n*   Waiting Period (Applies to illness only): 15 days after taking the policy / Minimum of 3 nights after hospitalization.\n*   Duration Covered:1year\n\n_Exclusions:_\n\n*   _Pre-existing conditions._\n*   _Hospitalisation for pregnancy, maternity, and fertility-related treatments._\n*   _Cosmetic treatments, plastic surgery, refractive error corrective procedures, experimental, investigational, or unproven procedures or treatments._\n*   _Hospitalization for self-inflicted injuries._\n\n## We’re human, above all else\n\nAt Heirs Insurance Group, you are our priority.
